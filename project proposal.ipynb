    "Crypto-currencies have recently gained a lot of attention from both industry and academia because it can potentially solve many practical problems associated with the Fiat currency. All crypto-currencies are powered by a distributed immutable public database called <b> BlockChain </b> that is maintained by thousands of nodes running accross the globe. Any transaction ever made in crypto-currency is written in the <b> BlockChain </b> and can be easily verified by anyone. The fundamental benefit of crypto-currency is that it is not regulated by any central authoriy and it allowes direct peer to peer money transfer without the need of any intermediate third party. <b> Bitcoin </b> is the first crypto-currency and currently has the largest market cap. With the success of <b> Bitcoin</b>, many other crypto-currencies like <b> Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple </b> etc. have been introduced."

    "Since its inception, the crypto-currency market has experienced a phenominal growth. As a result, this new marketplace has attracted many investors from all walks of lives. Since there is no central authority to regulate the crypto-currency  market, it is extremely volatile in nature and is often affected by socially constructed opinions; whether those opinions have basis in facts, or not. It has an immense impact on its price from fake news or rumors also. As a result, opinions and information about crypto-currency in the news and social media sphere are prevalent to its price fluctuation. For instance, <b>John McAfee</b>, is a well known crypto pionneer. He is also famous for manipulating the cypto market. In December 2017, he started posting the pospect of several crypto-currencies. Based on his repuration the coin he was mentioning was seeing a sudden pump in the price. One example is Red coin (RDD). He did the following tweet:\n",
    "\n",
    "<i><b>\"Coin of the day: Reddcoin (RDD) - a sleeper - most widely used social network coin in the world - flying under the radar since 2014. Working with every Social Media platform, it is the only currency that many children under the age of 10 have ever known.\"</b></i>\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/john_rdd.png\",width=500,height=450>\n",
    "\n",
    "After the tweets the RDD had a huge spike on its price within seconds. The price was increased by 400%. It was number 1 as the trading volume in several crypto exchanges. The black arrow on the image shows the sudden price movement on that particular time.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/rdd_price.png\",width=352,height=276>\n",

    "Later, John McAfee also tweets for various other cryptos. For which the crypto market also observed the similar trends. Below is the link of John McAfee tweets regading RDD. \n",

    "The market is also affected both positively and negatively by the government or organization level  decisions. On April 1st 2017, Japan enacted a law that accepted Bitcoin has a legal payment method. Since then, Bitcoin trading volume has skyrocketed and increased its value by 80%. During this time, Japan surpassed China and became the world's largest Bitcoin market in the world. The figure below illustrates the strike enacted by Japan's legalization of the cryptocurrency.

The government has frozen the opening of new virtual accounts and cryptocurrency traders will not be allowed to make deposits into their virtual currency exchange wallets, unless the name of their cryptocurrency exchange matches that of their bank accounts. Combined with this regulation, rumors of complete crypto currency ban began to escalate that resulted in 40% price drop on a single day (dubbed as \"Black Tuesday\"). The crypto currency market is still recovering from that downfall to this date. The following figure depicts the price drop on that day.

We are using both programming language R with \"streamR\" package and python with the \"tweepy\" library. We used both languages for achieving better datasets as stream API has some limitation and sometimes it became stop working and hence there can be a disruption in the collection process. We already collected more than 3 millions of tweets in this steps and stored as JSON. The collection of tweets is still in progress and we expect to collect more than 10 millions of tweets for our project.

    "Our primary background research suggests that social media especially Twitter has a tremendous impact on the crypto-currency market. There are some crypto trade bots which can trade based on positive and negative news. However, there is no available open and efficient prediction model which shows the social media and news impacts on the crypto-currencies in real time. Such model can be useful to analyze the crypto market and also helpful for both investor and researcher. \n",

We intend to predict the possible price for a certain future time period and evaluate our predictive model. "
